# Scope

This document outlines the scope of work undertaken by the Creator Assertions Working Group’s Training and Data Mining Assertion project.

## Objectives

The objective of this project is to refresh and update the training and data mining assertion specification.

This assertion enables a human actor to provide a C2PA Manifest Consumer information about whether the asset may be used as part of a data mining or AI/ML training workflow.

This assertion was removed in the C2PA 2.0 specification. This project will re-publish that specification as a product of the Creator Assertions Working Group.

## Membership and joining

This specification is being developed under the [Community Specification 1.0 License](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/1.0/1._Community_Specification_License-v1.md). Contributors to this specification must adhere to the license, as outlined in the repository’s [license file](/license.md) file.

## Deliverables

This Working Group shall produce a version 1.0 of an training and data mining assertion specification which shall reflect the consensus of the members at that time. The Working Group may produce subsequent versions of the specification.

## Meeting schedule and notes

See [CAWG: Meeting schedule](https://creator-assertions.github.io/#_meeting_schedule) for meeting schedule and notes from previous meetings.

## Dependencies

The training and data mining assertion specification must align with the C2PA Technical Specification that is current as of the time of publication. The specification may also describe compatibility with previous versions of the C2PA Technical Specification.
